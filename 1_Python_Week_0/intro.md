# Welcome to Python Beginner Coding

## Python Week 0
This week we will be learning the Killercoda IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to make sure you are familiar with it and are set up for the first learning session next time.

We will go through all the steps to get the code running for yourself in a terminal but also your own Python files.
